We support activities that benefit graduate students. All requests are public. For amounts at or above the voting threshold set in our bylaws, the council will vote in **Discussions**.

**Apply for funding:**

- [Open the funding request form](https://github.com/JesseZhou-1/gsc-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=funding-request%2Cpending-review&projects=&template=funding.yml&title=Funding+request%3A+%3Cevent+or+project+name%3E)

**Review queue:**

- [Open requests](https://github.com/JesseZhou-1/gsc-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afunding-request)
- [Approved](https://github.com/JesseZhou-1/gsc-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aapproved)
- [Rejected](https://github.com/JesseZhou-1/gsc-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Arejected)

**Voting for large requests:**

If the amount is at or above the threshold, a council officer will open a **Poll** in Discussions and link it here via a comment. After voting closes, we label the request `approved` or `rejected` and record the decision.

**Contact:** Treasurer and Chair are tagged on each request. Use the comment thread to ask or answer questions.
